## About

This is a skeleton project specially crafted for design pattern implementation. It has React + Redux frontend togheter with .NET 6 API in the backend.
This project was created with the intent (and some hints as well!) to implement design patterns for this game.

## Main idea
Genre of the game is turn based tower defense game (although as this is a skeleton - you can easily convert it to realtime game as well).

The main objective is to defeat your oponent using your special items such as rockets or shields.

## Why this skeleton will benefit you?

There is litterally everything on the front end that you will need to implement all of the design patterns. Although you may need to tweak it a little bit depending on your needs. This project is heavily back-end oriented in terms of design patterns.

## Developer guide

The solution is written in React + Redux as well as .NET 6 API for the backend. It uses REST for turn based communication and SignalR for realtime communication.

### Quick start guide

In order to start the solution you will need following prerequisites:
* Visual Studio 2022 (or greater)
* .NET 6 SDK installed (should be available through Visual Studio Installer)
* Node.JS
